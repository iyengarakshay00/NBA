# Data 

## Sources
Talk about getting from espn: 
We got data from ESPN. For part of our data, I went to scrape the data and get it from ESPN. Because of this, we were able to get a bunch of tables from different years and teams. We needed to make sure that webscraping the data from the site is legal and ethical. That is why we didn't edit any of the numbers and made sure the data was in the correct format.


## Cleaning / transformation

Cleaning is done in the results section with the code, talk about getting data in not useful form, changing data types, converting, adding columns, binding into one table, adding variable for year and divisions

## Missing value analysis
Add a table using visna to show missing info and describe
