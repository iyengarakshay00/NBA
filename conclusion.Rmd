# Conclusion

The main takeaways of our exploration start with the process of beginning a data science visualization project. We were able to see different breakdown of player data and season performance. The graphs visually entice the audience and provide powerful messages about how people performed in different years in a professional basketball league. We would love to pull all seasons data complete with everything. This would be a lengthy amount considering the NBA pulls back to 100s of years ago. Also, the team data would look very different as there were different teams and league points can't be compared because of the size of the league back then and now. For the future for season performance, we would love to explore additional variables such as coach impact and injuries. These variables might be able to provide a powerful association for how a team performs in the league and in post-season/playoffs. Some of the lessons learned are that gathering the right data takes the right questions and right primary sources. Because the sources are primary, our insights can be more generalized. The right kinds of color and visualizations do really make the project. Audiences can be pulled in to a really good story and the visualization can tell that story if it fits or makes sense with the data.

In regards to shot data, in the future we'd like to pull data for all players instead of only the top 100. With enough time and resources, this should be possible. Doing so would roughly double our dataset, so hopefully the trends we've observed here would hold.
